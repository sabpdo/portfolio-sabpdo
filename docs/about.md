# About Me

### Who Am I?

Hello! My name is Sabrina Do, and I'm a current junior at MIT studying 6-3. 

### Where am I from?

I was originally born and raised in Orange County, California.

### What am I looking forward to in 6.1040?

I'm super excited to learn more about software design in general and the principles behind what makes an app intuitive and user-friendly in 6.1040. In the past I've worked on developing web apps, but I would love to learn more about it in a formalized manner.
