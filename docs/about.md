# About Me

Hello! My name is Sabrina Do, and I'm a current junior at MIT studying 6-3. I was originally born and raised in Orange County, California.

I'm super excited to learn more about software design in general and the principles behind what makes an app intuitive and user-friendly in 6.1040. In the past I've worked on developing web apps, but I would love to learn more about it in a formalized manner.
