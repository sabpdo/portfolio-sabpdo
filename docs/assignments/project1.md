## Draft Impact Case 

__Problem Statement:__

The USDA estimates that 30-40% of the US food supply, worth $161 billion, is wasted. When food is discarded, it not only is a large financial loss but also generates environmental harm. As food decomposes in landfills, it releases methane—a greenhouse gas up to 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its short-term climate impact. In fact, food waste alone contributes 6-8% of all human-driven greenhouse gas emissions globally. The environmental toll does not stop at emissions; producing, transporting, and disposing of this wasted food consumes significant water and energy resources, further straining our ecosystems and intensifying climate change.

Meanwhile, the social implications of food waste are equally grave. Approximately 18 million U.S. households experience food insecurity each year, which means that millions of people do not have reliable access to enough nutritious food to lead healthy lives. This paradox—of food scarcity amidst surplus—is unnecessary, as there is more than enough food produced to meet the nutritional needs of every American.

Given the sheer scale and urgency of the issue, addressing food waste presents an invaluable opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases, conserve vital resources, and combat food insecurity. The economic costs, environmental degradation, and human suffering associated with food waste require action.

__Solution Hypothesis:__

Our solution to address these problems is to connect food-insecure individuals with restaurants. Restaurants annually generate 22-33 billion pounds of food per year, so our application will aim to redirect this food away from the landfill and into the stomachs of people who could benefit from it. More specifically, we would have restaurants list their leftover food at the end of the day which food insecure individuals could pick up and eat.

We believe food redistribution is a good solution because it addresses the problems of food waste and climate change head-on, connecting two resources that would otherwise be disconnected and lead to dissatisfaction from both parties, the food insecure and the surplus of the restaurants – those in need will then have a more reliable source of meals, and a significant amount of waste will be saved from the environment in the process.

__Outcome Measurement:__

We could measure the amount of food (in lbs or pure quantity) that is being repurposed over time (and thus being saved from disposal) to prove that our application is a good solution to food waste . For food insecurity, we could measure how many users receive new food. While it is difficult to measure the direct impacts on climate change, we may be able to estimate the reduced food waste and thus average carbon emissions reductions based on pure numbers of how many donation transactions were received.

## Research Findings

## VSD Analysis
__Indirect Stakeholders__

Indirect stakeholders could include local government health inspectors, who may need to be indirectly involved to ensure food safety standards are being met. Additionally, customers of restaurants who donate could also be affected indirectly, since their perception of a restaurant might be affected positively or negatively based on the restaurant’s image and social initiatives and also based on the perceived freshness or quality of the food. Food banks or shelters that also don’t participate in use of the app could potentially be affected and see lower attendance numbers or decreased funding.

__Non-targeted Use__

Without proper vetting of who is accepting or requesting donations, people could misuse the app by taking restaurant donations when they aren’t actually in need, or people may try to redirect donated food for resale for personal profit.

__Reappropriation__

The app could be repurposed for broader food-sharing beyond just restaurants, and grow to allow individuals to share surplus food from their own home kitchens. However, this could add in additional complexities for food safety concerns, since it’s harder to make sure that a home kitchen is up to code for food safety, and it’s difficult to track allergens. The app could also be repurposed for restaurants or businesses to monitor local food waste, which would influence both restaurant practices and food consumption patterns.

__Adaptation__

One possible negative adaptation could be that restaurants start relying on the app as a convenient “disposal” method for their food waste rather than focusing on inventory management or sustainable practices to reduce waste in the first place. This could lower the incentive for restaurants to manage inventory to prevent food waste at the source, since they have a quick and socially beneficial way to get rid of excess food, which could inadvertently lead to more food waste rather than less. 

__Choosing Not to Use__

Restaurants who choose not to donate leftover food could be perceived as less community-oriented or socially responsible, which would reflect negatively on their reputation, particularly among consumers who may be socially conscious. This could cause them to choose to dine somewhere else, so over time, this non-participation may affect business success due to negative perception. Additionally, non-use of the app could lead to missed opportunities to network with local non-profits or other businesses, which could isolate certain restaurants from networks that could provide future business opportunities. Non-use of the app could also limit the app’s overall effectiveness, especially for non-profits or organizations that rely on it to coordinate resources, which would lead to inefficiencies in food distribution.

__Long-Term Health and Well-Being__

There could be both positive and negative effects on people’s health and well-being in the long-term. On the positive side, by making nutritious food available to those in need, the app can contribute to better physical health outcomes for low-income or food-insecure populations, especially since fresh food such as fruits, vegetables, and protein, typically are less affordable than highly processed foods. This indirectly could also improve mental health for those who are food-insecure, since they would have less stress over where to find their next nutritious meal, and it could also give them a stronger sense of community and social support knowing that their local restaurants are committed to reducing food waste. The app could also lead to environmental health benefits by redirecting leftover food away from landfills and lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with food decomposition. This reduction in waste can improve environmental health in the community, leading to cleaner air and lower pollution levels, ultimately benefiting both individual health and the ecosystem. However, there are some potential health risks from food safety issues: while the app aims to reduce waste, the donation of leftover food that is nearing expiration could carry risks of foodborne illnesses if it’s not handled or stored properly and distributed in a timely manner. Over time, poor handling could result in health complications, particularly for those with compromised immune systems, if strict safety protocols are not maintained.

__Diverse Geographies__

In urban areas, the app would probably function well, since there would be a high density of both restaurants willing to donate food, and food banks throughout the area. However, in more rural areas with a lower population density, there would be limited access to both restaurants with excess food and food banks that are geographically close enough to have an effective distribution of food across the population. The food would likely have to be transported much further in order to reach those in need, and food banks that do exist would be harder to access for people without reliable access to transportation. The app could try to partner with local transportation services to address this if they are available, such as adding stops in bus routes to access food banks.

__Variation in Human Ability__

It’s important to consider that the food-insecure often includes people who are unable to work because of different abilities or conditions. The app can break down such that someone with limited vision or hearing would not be able to go through the regular app flows and request food, accept donations, and whatnot, so to mitigate this, we should introduce text to speech and other accessibility features. And for motor control, keep the buttons large and separate such that the app can be used without any hassle.

__Crossing National Boundaries__

Different countries have different food safety standards and cultural norms around food redistribution, so we should consider where this application can work best. In some countries, sharing food might not be as highly encouraged, and there are certainly countries with higher stigmas around accepting food donations, which would discourage use of the app.

__Desired Values__

The central values that our system should uphold include community, sustainability, and inclusivity – community in the sense that new connections are made between food donors and recipients, and that there is mutual support, a lasting positive dynamic that bolsters social harmony outside of the food redistribution itself.

__User Experience of Values__

Regarding the values that the users directly experience when using the app, the app by design would reinforce the positive values of community and purpose – the food insecure will get the food they need and feel supported and not an alienated outcast, while the food donors such as restaurants and stores will feel a sense of purpose, that their surplus food is not going to waste, and it’s saving lives. The only unintentional outcome is that if the app for some reason is not anonymous for the food insecure, the recipient might feel their privacy is at risk, and will feel the stigma of using the app, so to avoid that, it should be anonymous for the recipients.

__Environmental Sustainability__

This is one of the predominant values of the app, and is sustainable simply by its own nature, as it redistributes what would otherwise be landfill waste directly to those in need, reducing the carbon footprints associated with food disposal. One unintended negative effect on sustainability could be the transport/delivery of food between recipient and donor, if not optimized, it could create a carbon footprint that negates the benefits, especially in rural areas as suggested earlier, so to mitigate that, we should emphasize in-person pickups or deliveries whenever possible through walking, biking, or public transportation.

## List of Interview Roles and Potential Interviewees

In selecting interviewees, we identified two main categories of stakeholders—those specializing in food waste and those focusing on food insecurity. On the food waste side, we considered individuals with practical experience and influence over waste generation and management within the food service and retail environments. These include grocery store employees, baristas, restaurant workers, and sanitation professionals. For the food insecurity perspective, we aimed to speak with people who experience food insecurity firsthand as well as individuals working within community food programs, such as food pantry and kitchen staff. Additionally, we sought experts working in sustainability, who could provide insights into broader conservation efforts and sustainable practices.

_Potential Interviewee Roles_:
- Grocery store employees
- Baristas
- Restaurant staff
- Waste management and sanitation workers
- Food pantry and kitchen staff
- Farmers
- Sustainability advocates
- Individuals experiencing food insecurity


### Rationale for Interviewee Selection

#### Why We Chose Tam
Tam’s interview aimed to uncover practical challenges and gaps in current food waste management practices within food service settings. A 25-year-old with experience across five different food service establishments—from large restaurants and family-owned Vietnamese eateries to a café—Tam was chosen for her firsthand knowledge of operational practices. In her role as a barista, she regularly encounters food and beverage waste, giving her a direct perspective on the day-to-day waste handling practices in her café. Tam’s insights are crucial for understanding the informal and formal waste management policies at her workplace, helping to reveal potential areas for improved recycling and waste reduction initiatives.

#### Why We Chose Nicole

The purpose of this interview is to identify practical challenges and gaps in existing practices related to food waste management within a food service environment, specifically in a restaurant setting. Nicole, a 19-year-old college student whose parents own and run a Chinese restaurant was chosen as an interviewee for her experience in the food industry within a family-run business. As someone involved in the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, she likely has first-hand insight into the challenges of inventory management and implementation of sustainable practices at the restaurant. We may be able to better understand how small family-owned restaurants navigate food waste and what barriers and bottlenecks they face.

#### Why We Chose Anita

Anita is a 32-year-old living in a rural town in Alabama with her wife, her father, and her pets. After the loss of her grandmother and her wife losing her job at a local fast food restaurant, Anita and her family have struggled with food insecurity on a daily basis, especially given rising grocery prices after COVID-19, limited access to food pantries, and the stigma she experiences as a lesbian in her highly religious community. She faces several obstacles to accessing food as a disabled person and primary caregiver in a small, resource-limited town, so we thought she would be able to provide unique insight into the challenges faced with respect to food insecurity. Her story highlights the need for solutions that address both practical and social barriers, making her an ideal interviewee.
