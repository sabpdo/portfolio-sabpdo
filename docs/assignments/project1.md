## Draft Impact Case


__Problem Statement:__


The USDA estimates that 30-40% of the US food supply, worth $161 billion, is wasted. When food is discarded, it not only is a large financial loss but also generates environmental harm. As food decomposes in landfills, it releases methane—a greenhouse gas up to 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its short-term climate impact. In fact, food waste alone contributes 6-8% of all human-driven greenhouse gas emissions globally. The environmental toll does not stop at emissions; producing, transporting, and disposing of this wasted food consumes significant water and energy resources, further straining our ecosystems and intensifying climate change.


Meanwhile, the social implications of food waste are equally grave. Approximately 18 million U.S. households experience food insecurity each year, which means that millions of people do not have reliable access to enough nutritious food to lead healthy lives. This paradox—of food scarcity amidst surplus—is unnecessary, as there is more than enough food produced to meet the nutritional needs of every American.


Given the sheer scale and urgency of the issue, addressing food waste presents an invaluable opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases, conserve vital resources, and combat food insecurity. The economic costs, environmental degradation, and human suffering associated with food waste require action.


__Solution Hypothesis:__


Our solution to address these problems is to connect food-insecure individuals with restaurants. Restaurants annually generate 22-33 billion pounds of food per year, so our application will aim to redirect this food away from the landfill and into the stomachs of people who could benefit from it. More specifically, we would have restaurants list their leftover food at the end of the day which food insecure individuals could pick up and eat.


We believe food redistribution is a good solution because it addresses the problems of food waste and climate change head-on, connecting two resources that would otherwise be disconnected and lead to dissatisfaction from both parties, the food insecure and the surplus of the restaurants – those in need will then have a more reliable source of meals, and a significant amount of waste will be saved from the environment in the process.


__Outcome Measurement:__


We could measure the amount of food (in lbs or pure quantity) that is being repurposed over time (and thus being saved from disposal) to prove that our application is a good solution to food waste . For food insecurity, we could measure how many users receive new food. While it is difficult to measure the direct impacts on climate change, we may be able to estimate the reduced food waste and thus average carbon emissions reductions based on pure numbers of how many donation transactions were received.

## Research Findings

### Food Insecurity
#### Support:
- Global Need: According to the USDA, 870 million people do not have a sufficient supply of nutritious and safe food. The demand for food will rise by 70% to 100% by 2050.
- Impact of Malnutrition on Health: Food insecurity is heavily linked to malnourishment, which has severe health implications. Poor nutrition contributes to stunted growth in youth, compromised immune system, and further contributes to the negative cycle of poverty.
#### Current Solutions
We looked at currently implemented successful solutions that incorporated similar aspects to our proposed impact case solution. 
- Global Agriculture and Food Security Program:
   - Goal: Provides funding for agriculture-related projects in low-income countries.
   - Actions: Funds are allocated for infrastructure, technology, and education programs that help to build sustainable agricultural economies.
- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP):
   - Goal: Assist low-income families in the U.S. with food-purchasing assistance.
   - Actions: Provides benefits loaded onto an Electronic Benefit Transfer card at grocery stores and markets that provide around $6 per person per day.
- Food Pantries: Many food pantries exist whose goals are to distribute free food to people in need.
#### Gaps and Challenges:
While there exists many solutions to food insecurity, there exists many gaps in currently existing programs which we detail below.
- Access and Affordability:
   - Inconsistent Access: Many low-income individuals still lack consistent access to affordable, nutritious food due to high food prices and limited transportation options.
   - Rising Costs: Inflation has reduced purchasing power greatly for current solutions such as SNAP. The monetary aid provided often doesn’t cover the needs of beneficiaries and this gap leads many people to rely on cheaper and potentially less nutritious options. 
- Insufficient Government Support:
   - Inadequate Benefits: Government programs often fall short in covering basic food needs. For example, SNAP provides an average of only $6 per person per day, which is insufficient for a month’s worth of nutritious meals.
   - Food Bank Dependency: With limited funds from government programs, many food insecure households rely on food banks and community pantries, but these sources can be inconsistent, unreliable, and undersupplied.
- Awareness and Accessibility:
   - Lack of Public Awareness: Many businesses are unaware of the environmental and social impacts of food waste, and while some know about donation options, they lack incentives to act. For example, grocery stores and restaurants often prefer to discard food due to low disposal costs and conservative expiration dates that restrict donations. Programs like tax credits for food donations exist but are often underpublicized, so businesses may not understand the financial benefits of participation.
   - Limited Accessibility of Information: Information on available resources is often limited and not widely shared, making it harder for communities to access the aid they need.
- Long-Term Sustainability:
   - Dependency on Emergency Aid: Many individuals’ reliance on food banks and temporary aid reflect potential gaps in long term factors such as income inequality and education.
### Food Waste
#### Support:
- Scale of the Issue:
   - Food waste accounts for 30-40% of the food supply in the U.S. Food waste occurs at multiple points in the supply chain, including during production, distribution, and consumption.
   - 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills, constituting 21% of municipal solid waste.
- Benefits of Reducing Food Waste:
   - Reducing food waste lowers methane emissions and leads to cost savings across the supply chain.
   - Food services and consumers contribute heavily, with 60% of waste occurring at the consumption stage, and food services responsible for 34% of that.
#### Current Solutions
- UN Goals:
   - Goal: Aim to improve practices around food production, storage, and consumer purchasing behaviors and to halve food waste by 2030.
   - Actions: Promotes sustainable agricultural practices, encourages consumer awareness, and supports policies that reduce food loss and waste globally.
- Food Recovery Networks:
   - Goal: Connect food donors (e.g., grocery stores, restaurants) with hunger relief organizations to repurpose surplus food.
   - Actions: Connects food donors, like grocery stores and restaurants, with hunger relief organizations. This allows surplus food to be repurposed and redirected to those facing food insecurity rather than ending up in landfills.
#### Gaps and Challenges
- Low Awareness and Incentive:
   - Limited Awareness: Many consumers and businesses are unaware of the scale and environmental impact of food waste, leading to continued inefficiencies.
- Inadequate Incentives: Businesses often find it easier and more cost-effective to discard food than to donate it, as disposal costs are low and expiration dates are set conservatively.
- Food Recovery Potential:
   - Opportunity for Redistribution: It’s estimated that if 30% of food waste in the U.S. were recovered, it could feed all food-insecure Americans. This represents a substantial missed opportunity for efficient food redistribution.
- Inventory Management:
   - Demand for Variety: Poor forecasting and inventory management contribute to overstock and waste. Consumer demand for variety and freshness drives high stocking levels, resulting in excess.
- Logistical Barriers in Redistribution:
   - Coordination and Transportation: Food donation networks face logistical challenges, such as coordinating schedules and transportation for surplus food, which can lead to missed redistribution opportunities.
   - Short Shelf Life: Perishable foods with short shelf lives often complicate the distribution process, leading to waste even within donation networks.

## VSD Analysis
__Indirect Stakeholders__


Indirect stakeholders could include local government health inspectors, who may need to be indirectly involved to ensure food safety standards are being met. Additionally, customers of restaurants who donate could also be affected indirectly, since their perception of a restaurant might be affected positively or negatively based on the restaurant’s image and social initiatives and also based on the perceived freshness or quality of the food. Food banks or shelters that also don’t participate in use of the app could potentially be affected and see lower attendance numbers or decreased funding.


__Non-targeted Use__


Without proper vetting of who is accepting or requesting donations, people could misuse the app by taking restaurant donations when they aren’t actually in need, or people may try to redirect donated food for resale for personal profit.


__Reappropriation__


The app could be repurposed for broader food-sharing beyond just restaurants, and grow to allow individuals to share surplus food from their own home kitchens. However, this could add in additional complexities for food safety concerns, since it’s harder to make sure that a home kitchen is up to code for food safety, and it’s difficult to track allergens. The app could also be repurposed for restaurants or businesses to monitor local food waste, which would influence both restaurant practices and food consumption patterns.


__Adaptation__


One possible negative adaptation could be that restaurants start relying on the app as a convenient “disposal” method for their food waste rather than focusing on inventory management or sustainable practices to reduce waste in the first place. This could lower the incentive for restaurants to manage inventory to prevent food waste at the source, since they have a quick and socially beneficial way to get rid of excess food, which could inadvertently lead to more food waste rather than less.


__Choosing Not to Use__


Restaurants who choose not to donate leftover food could be perceived as less community-oriented or socially responsible, which would reflect negatively on their reputation, particularly among consumers who may be socially conscious. This could cause them to choose to dine somewhere else, so over time, this non-participation may affect business success due to negative perception. Additionally, non-use of the app could lead to missed opportunities to network with local non-profits or other businesses, which could isolate certain restaurants from networks that could provide future business opportunities. Non-use of the app could also limit the app’s overall effectiveness, especially for non-profits or organizations that rely on it to coordinate resources, which would lead to inefficiencies in food distribution.


__Long-Term Health and Well-Being__


There could be both positive and negative effects on people’s health and well-being in the long-term. On the positive side, by making nutritious food available to those in need, the app can contribute to better physical health outcomes for low-income or food-insecure populations, especially since fresh food such as fruits, vegetables, and protein, typically are less affordable than highly processed foods. This indirectly could also improve mental health for those who are food-insecure, since they would have less stress over where to find their next nutritious meal, and it could also give them a stronger sense of community and social support knowing that their local restaurants are committed to reducing food waste. The app could also lead to environmental health benefits by redirecting leftover food away from landfills and lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with food decomposition. This reduction in waste can improve environmental health in the community, leading to cleaner air and lower pollution levels, ultimately benefiting both individual health and the ecosystem. However, there are some potential health risks from food safety issues: while the app aims to reduce waste, the donation of leftover food that is nearing expiration could carry risks of foodborne illnesses if it’s not handled or stored properly and distributed in a timely manner. Over time, poor handling could result in health complications, particularly for those with compromised immune systems, if strict safety protocols are not maintained.


__Diverse Geographies__


In urban areas, the app would probably function well, since there would be a high density of both restaurants willing to donate food, and food banks throughout the area. However, in more rural areas with a lower population density, there would be limited access to both restaurants with excess food and food banks that are geographically close enough to have an effective distribution of food across the population. The food would likely have to be transported much further in order to reach those in need, and food banks that do exist would be harder to access for people without reliable access to transportation. The app could try to partner with local transportation services to address this if they are available, such as adding stops in bus routes to access food banks.


__Variation in Human Ability__


It’s important to consider that the food-insecure often includes people who are unable to work because of different abilities or conditions. The app can break down such that someone with limited vision or hearing would not be able to go through the regular app flows and request food, accept donations, and whatnot, so to mitigate this, we should introduce text to speech and other accessibility features. And for motor control, keep the buttons large and separate such that the app can be used without any hassle.


__Crossing National Boundaries__


Different countries have different food safety standards and cultural norms around food redistribution, so we should consider where this application can work best. In some countries, sharing food might not be as highly encouraged, and there are certainly countries with higher stigmas around accepting food donations, which would discourage use of the app.


__Desired Values__


The central values that our system should uphold include community, sustainability, and inclusivity – community in the sense that new connections are made between food donors and recipients, and that there is mutual support, a lasting positive dynamic that bolsters social harmony outside of the food redistribution itself.


__User Experience of Values__


Regarding the values that the users directly experience when using the app, the app by design would reinforce the positive values of community and purpose – the food insecure will get the food they need and feel supported and not an alienated outcast, while the food donors such as restaurants and stores will feel a sense of purpose, that their surplus food is not going to waste, and it’s saving lives. The only unintentional outcome is that if the app for some reason is not anonymous for the food insecure, the recipient might feel their privacy is at risk, and will feel the stigma of using the app, so to avoid that, it should be anonymous for the recipients.


__Environmental Sustainability__


This is one of the predominant values of the app, and is sustainable simply by its own nature, as it redistributes what would otherwise be landfill waste directly to those in need, reducing the carbon footprints associated with food disposal. One unintended negative effect on sustainability could be the transport/delivery of food between recipient and donor, if not optimized, it could create a carbon footprint that negates the benefits, especially in rural areas as suggested earlier, so to mitigate that, we should emphasize in-person pickups or deliveries whenever possible through walking, biking, or public transportation.


## List of Interview Roles and Potential Interviewees


In selecting interviewees, we identified two main categories of stakeholders—those specializing in food waste and those focusing on food insecurity. On the food waste side, we considered individuals with practical experience and influence over waste generation and management within the food service and retail environments. These include grocery store employees, baristas, restaurant workers, and sanitation professionals. For the food insecurity perspective, we aimed to speak with people who experience food insecurity firsthand as well as individuals working within community food programs, such as food pantry and kitchen staff. Additionally, we sought experts working in sustainability, who could provide insights into broader conservation efforts and sustainable practices.


_Potential Interviewee Roles_:
- Grocery store employees
- Baristas
- Restaurant staff
- Waste management and sanitation workers
- Food pantry and kitchen staff
- Farmers
- Sustainability advocates
- Individuals experiencing food insecurity




### Rationale for Interviewee Selection


#### Why We Chose Tam
Tam’s interview aimed to uncover practical challenges and gaps in current food waste management practices within food service settings. A 25-year-old with experience across five different food service establishments—from large restaurants and family-owned Vietnamese eateries to a café—Tam was chosen for her firsthand knowledge of operational practices. In her role as a barista, she regularly encounters food and beverage waste, giving her a direct perspective on the day-to-day waste handling practices in her café. Tam’s insights are crucial for understanding the informal and formal waste management policies at her workplace, helping to reveal potential areas for improved recycling and waste reduction initiatives.


#### Why We Chose Nicole


The purpose of this interview is to identify practical challenges and gaps in existing practices related to food waste management within a food service environment, specifically in a restaurant setting. Nicole, a 19-year-old college student whose parents own and run a Chinese restaurant was chosen as an interviewee for her experience in the food industry within a family-run business. As someone involved in the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, she likely has first-hand insight into the challenges of inventory management and implementation of sustainable practices at the restaurant. We may be able to better understand how small family-owned restaurants navigate food waste and what barriers and bottlenecks they face.


#### Why We Chose Anita


Anita is a 32-year-old living in a rural town in Alabama with her wife, her father, and her pets. After the loss of her grandmother and her wife losing her job at a local fast food restaurant, Anita and her family have struggled with food insecurity on a daily basis, especially given rising grocery prices after COVID-19, limited access to food pantries, and the stigma she experiences as a lesbian in her highly religious community. She faces several obstacles to accessing food as a disabled person and primary caregiver in a small, resource-limited town, so we thought she would be able to provide unique insight into the challenges faced with respect to food insecurity. Her story highlights the need for solutions that address both practical and social barriers, making her an ideal interviewee.

#### Why We Chose Rose & Kate
Rose and Kate are two members of MIT’s Food Security Action Team, and we reached out hoping to talk to one of them, but both are available, so the more the merrier. Given they represent one organization and will speak to me at the same time, I’m considering them as one interviewee. They provide useful insight into what food insecurity looks like in our community, in our campus, and how we can develop a solution tailored to that. They have a lot of experience with research and logistics and the ins and outs, so they can definitely test the feasibility of a solution and what to expect when implementing the app. They will also have a useful perspective on food waste and redistribution as a whole in our community. Overall, the “expert” of our interviewees.

## Interview Summaries

Through our interviews with Anita, Tam, Nicole, Rose, and Kate, we gained insights into not only food insecurity but also the complex dynamics and contradictions surrounding food waste practices in the food and restaurant industry. 

One of our interviewees was Anita – a 32-year-old from a small rural town in Alabama who lives with her wife, her disabled father, and her pets. Unable to work due to physical disabilities, and with her wife recently losing her job, Anita described going days without eating as “a dehumanizing feeling to know that once this little bit of food is gone, there’s no way to get any more.” The food resources she is able to access are often inadequate: her local food pantry only does distributions of a couple cans once a month, which is not enough to sustain her family of 3. Given how expensive foods like meat and fresh produce are, they often have to rely on cheaper, processed foods that leave her family’s nutritional needs unmet. A neighborhood-based app like a Nextdoor for food where people can share surplus food with neighbors, would allow communities to connect to share fresh, nutritious food and reduce waste while fostering support networks. This would also allow people to access healthy options like fresh produce, and limit food waste produced by individual households.

Social stigma has also posed barriers. Most pantries in Anita’s area are church-run, and Anita and her wife have often feared judgment as a lesbian couple, where assumptions about their relationship have made them feel unwelcome. Building a distribution system that allows people to request or pick up food anonymously using designated drop-off points in accessible, safe, and non-judgmental locations like community centers or fire stations would reduce stigma and social anxiety; for users like Anita who fear judgment based on their identity or circumstances, this would make food assistance more approachable for everyone.

Another surprising issue about food insecurity was the difficulty of access/transportation. Living in a rural area with limited resources has made it even more difficult for Anita to find food. Pantries are at least a 30-minute drive away, a distance she often can’t afford in gas money. When resources run low, Anita is forced to make heartbreaking choices: “You have to pick and choose every day: gas or food? Doctor’s appointment or food? Medication for the month or food?” For Anita, food insecurity isn’t just about finances; it’s an all-consuming source of stress, especially with depression and anxiety already impacting her mental health. “Every day, I wake up and wonder where the next meal will come from. It’s just exhausting,” she reflected. “And I think about my dad: most days he asks if we’re going to be able to eat tonight, and I don’t know.”

Anita also realized that she has found most food pantries or resources through word of mouth rather than online, and that she would never have known if someone hadn’t told her, highlighting a need for a collection of local resources for people. Creating an accessible, centralized database/map that consolidates crowd-sourced local food resources, food pantries, free meal locations, and support programs would provide a “one-stop-shop” where users can easily find nearby services, updated availability, and eligibility information. This would save users time and also make sure limited resources like gas are put to good use. 

Rose and Kate from the MIT Food Security Action Team provide a different perspective on existing solutions to food insecurity – the MIT Food Security Action Team addresses food insecurity through high-level research and program suggestions, rather than directly providing meals. They emphasize one particular unique challenge and tension: time constraints rather than financial access to food. While typical food insecurity is tied to money, students often struggle to find time to eat due to their busy schedules. According to a quality of life survey, around 10% of students face food insecurity, with time being the primary issue. In response, the team has developed numerous programs to help, which have all received positive reception. 

Despite these efforts, the team has faced challenges with more ambitious food distribution programs. For example, the low-cost TechMart grocery store in Walker, which existed a long time before us, was underused and ultimately not sustainable, seen by them as a “DSL money pit.” Food pantries have similarly seen low engagement, and the effort to redistribute food (e.g., via the Banana Lounge) has required significant human resources. Free delivery programs at Daily Table (a nonprofit grocery store) during IAP failed to generate enough demand to be sustainable. The “demand and the need just isn’t there.” Overall, the team is focused on finding scalable, sustainable solutions to address the time-based nature of food insecurity at MIT. The detailed perspectives around logistics and food insecurity on campus inform our project very well, providing insight into the tensions of time and human resources. Building on existing infrastructure can help reduce the labor required for distribution.

Not only did we gain insights into food insecurity and potential solutions, but we also gained valuable insights into food waste practices within the restaurant industry from interviews with Nicole and Tam. 

One initial surprise was the lack of awareness about food redistribution programs, especially among smaller, family-owned establishments. When asked if her family’s restaurant participates in such initiatives, Nicole explained that her parents were largely unaware of them. She added that if the process were efficient and easy to navigate, her family would likely participate. This speaks to a significant educational gap: while small, independent establishments may have a strong commitment to reducing waste, they often lack information about how to do so effectively, limiting their involvement in sustainable practices. For these smaller restaurants, introducing accessible and well-publicized food redistribution programs could be transformative, allowing them to play a more active role in combating food waste.

This lack of awareness about food waste also extends to both consumers and restaurant staff. According to Tam, diners often over-order without understanding the broader implications of their waste. “Food waste education is really important because they don’t realize the journey between their food and the table,” she emphasized. Despite increased media coverage of food waste, the message often fails to reach consumers at critical moments, such as ordering, when it might influence their choices. This gap in awareness suggests a missed opportunity for more immediate, impactful change if awareness initiatives could be integrated into dining experiences.

A compelling tension was the contrast between small “mom-and-pop” establishments and larger chain restaurants. Nicole shared that her family’s restaurant typically has “5-10 orders not picked up every week,” a volume she explained is too small to be impactfully donated to shelters. This raised questions about which types of restaurants and food “receivers” could work most effectively together to reduce waste. Surprisingly, Tam noted that “mom-and-pop’s [are] more conscious” of food waste issues than big chains, which, despite having more resources, often dispose of unsold food. “Big chain[s]…don’t care at all—everything goes into the trash,” she said. This contradiction between expectation and reality exposes a key structural problem: while larger chains have the capacity to make a significant impact, they often lack both the support and incentives needed to prioritize food waste reduction.

The tension between the desire to be sustainable and practical constraints on time and finances was another theme that emerged from Nicole’s reflections. Small restaurants, she explained, face significant hurdles in food waste reduction due to limited staffing and tight schedules. “Our goal is to make sure we don’t waste too much,” she shared, “but with just a few people working here, it’s hard to have time for something like composting or donation.” Nicole described how her family often consumes any leftover food or, if they lack the time or interest, throws it away. This highlights the difficult choices that small restaurants make daily, where efforts to reduce waste are weighed against operational demands. For smaller establishments, waste reduction is often a practical, financially motivated decision rather than an ethical choice, revealing a clear need for solutions that align with their operational constraints.

Anita and Tam’s insights also underscored the need for stronger incentives and the influence of risk-related policies on food waste practices. Anita recalled working at Little Caesar’s, where she and other employees discarded hundreds of pounds of leftover pizzas each day that they were not allowed to take home, even when they themselves were in need. “I would just stare at it, reflecting, ‘What’s wrong with this company and these people? How is this okay?’” she shared. This experience points to a deeper issue: in many cases, food waste is driven by company policies rather than lack of willingness to redistribute food. 

Similarly, Tam observed that “big restaurants…need some incentive to properly compost the food,” highlighting the need for tangible rewards, such as a small financial incentive, to encourage sustainable practices. Liability concerns further compound this issue, as inconsistent food safety policies deter even well-meaning establishments from donating food out of fear of legal repercussions. This frustration, as Tam explained, leaves both employees and customers who wish to contribute feeling disempowered and discouraged by restrictive policies.

Community partnerships and volunteer-driven solutions emerge as promising opportunities to address both issues of lack of awareness about food waste and transportation difficulties for those who are food insecure. Collaborating with local nonprofits or food banks for donation drives and volunteer initiatives could ease the logistical burdens on smaller restaurants while fostering a sense of shared responsibility and community action. By engaging both employees and customers in sustainable practices, such partnerships would not only address structural and educational barriers but also create an environment where sustainability is a collective effort.

## Revised Impact Case
### Problem Statement:

The USDA estimates that 30-40% of the US food supply, worth $161 billion, is wasted. When food is discarded, it not only is a large financial loss but also generates environmental harm. As food decomposes in landfills, it releases methane—a greenhouse gas up to 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its short-term climate impact. In fact, food waste alone contributes 6-8% of all human-driven greenhouse gas emissions globally. Nicole, whose family owns a restaurant, voiced her frustration, saying, “Our goal is to make sure we don’t waste too much, but with just a few people working, it’s hard to have time for something like composting or donation.” Her words underscore the practical barriers that small establishments face, despite their desire to help reduce waste.

The environmental toll does not stop at emissions; producing, transporting, and disposing of this wasted food consumes significant water and energy resources, further straining our ecosystems and intensifying climate change.  Tam, a restaurant employee, highlighted this point: “Food waste education is really important because they don’t realize the journey between their food and the table.” Despite increased awareness, many consumers and businesses still lack the resources or knowledge to prevent waste effectively.

Meanwhile, the social implications of food waste are equally grave. Approximately 18 million U.S. households experience food insecurity each year, which means that millions of people do not have reliable access to enough nutritious food to lead healthy lives. Anita, who formerly worked at a pizza chain, recalled how hundreds of pounds of leftover pizza were discarded each day due to company policy prohibiting employees from taking them, despite the fact that she and other employees had nothing to eat at home. “I would just stare at it, reflecting, ‘What’s wrong with this company and these people? How is this okay?’” she shared. Her experience illustrates the needless suffering caused by a paradoxical system where there is more than enough food produced to meet the nutritional needs of every American.

Current solutions aim to redirect food waste to address food insecurity; however, many of these programs still exhibit gaps and insufficiencies. Food insecurity initiatives like the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program target food insecurity but often have limited impact due to inadequate financial coverage and insufficient government support and prioritization. In the case of food waste prevention, the general public is often not highly aware or incentivized to follow through with Food Recovery Networks and goals set forth by the UN, leading to minimal overall engagement with repurposing and reducing food waste.
Given the sheer scale and urgency of the issue, addressing food waste presents an invaluable opportunity to reduce greenhouse gasses, conserve vital resources, and combat food insecurity. The economic costs, environmental degradation, and human suffering associated with food waste require action.

### Solution Hypothesis:

Our solution to address these problems is to connect food-insecure individuals with restaurants. Restaurants annually generate 22-33 billion pounds of food per year, so our application will aim to redirect this food away from the landfill and into the stomachs of people who could benefit from it. More specifically, we would have restaurants list their leftover food at the end of the day (and potentially leave them at designated drop-off stops) which food insecure individuals could pick up and eat. 

We believe food redistribution is a good solution because it addresses the problems of food waste and climate change head-on, connecting two resources that would otherwise be disconnected and lead to dissatisfaction from both parties, the food insecure and the surplus of the restaurants. Those in need will then have a more reliable source of meals, and a significant amount of waste will be saved from the environment in the process.

To address the issue of transportation and access to food, especially in rural areas, our solution will incorporate a volunteer program similar to Doordash where drivers would pick up food from leftover food from restaurants and distribute it to those in need.

Not only will our solution include re-distribution, but it will also address other existing gaps that solutions have. Specifically, we also hope to incorporate a community-based component where people can share surplus food with neighbors, would allow communities to connect to share fresh, nutritious food and reduce waste while fostering support networks. This community based component can also include a centralized database/map that consolidates crowd-sourced local food resources, food pantries, free meal locations, and support programs that would provide a “one-stop-shop” where users can easily find nearby services, updated availability, and eligibility information. This would save users time and also make sure limited resources like gas are put to good use

### Outcome Measurement: 

We could measure the amount of food (in lbs or pure quantity) that is being repurposed over time (and thus being saved from disposal) to prove that our application is a good solution to food waste . For food insecurity, we could measure how many users receive new food. While it is difficult to measure the direct impacts on climate change, we may be able to estimate the reduced food waste and thus average carbon emissions reductions based on pure numbers of how many donation transactions were received.
