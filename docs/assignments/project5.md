## Deployed Site

Deployed Site: https://leftover-love.vercel.app/welcome

## Design Revisions

## Prepopulated Realistic Data
## 1. Prepopulate Data

Link To Website: https://goldenbookofficial.vercel.app/

To prepopulate the website, we created a number of real potential users. For each of the users, we enabled a number of different features, ranging from creating conversations between a couple of users, creating food donations, claiming food donations, and creating delivery requests.

You can log into the following accounts:
Restaurant Role
```
username: @Papa Johns

password: password
```

Volunteer Role
```
username: @Emily Chen

password: password
```

Recipient Role
```
username: @Sabrina Do

password: password
```
to see one of the example profiles!

I also have a couple of other false accounts besides my sample. I have populated the app with real messages to the accounts, food donations posts, food request claims, and food deliveries. 

Sample Conversation:
![Messages]TODO

Food Donation Posts:
![Posts]TODO

Food Claims
![Claim]TODO

Food Deliveries
![Delivery]
