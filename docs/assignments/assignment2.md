# Assignment 2: Divergent Design


## Broad Application Goals

__Name__: GoldenBook

__Intended Audience__: The intended audience will be elderly/older individuals. 

__Value__: GoldenBook will be the next app designed for elderly individuals -- it will focus on building community and connection for elderly individuals while also having features to help mitigate privacy and security risks that current social media apps lack.

## Feature Ideas Brainstorm

Collaborators: I helped brainstormed with Emily Chen.

### Feature 1: Adjustable Text Size
A big issue for older users tends to be the ability to read easily the text on applications/websites. A solution to this could be an adjustable slider bar that allows a user to adjust the page to the text size that would be most convenient for them.

### Feature 2: Automatically scheduled friend/family check-in

Sometimes keeping consistent contact with loved ones can be hard, especially for seniors trying to connect with the younger generation, so the app could automatically schedule periodic check-ins/get togethers on two parties' calendars.

### Feature 3: Background Verification for Users 
Users could have a verified feature tag that is only given once they do a background check, facial recognition check, or friend referal/validation.

### Feature 4: Location-based interest sharing friend recommendation

Location tends to be a big limiting factor for more elderly users, especially as mobility declines, so there could be social/friend recommendations that are suggested based off common interests and proximity.

### Feature 5: Postings board for social events

A commmunity board for social events based off one's location and interests can be generated, where users can easily post upcoming events -- almost like job postings but for events.

### Feature 6: Voice command integration

Texting/typing can be difficult for older users, so voice commands can be integrated to do basic functionality on the app. 

### Feature 7: Chatbot trained over privacy settings

Navigating the privacy settings can be confusing, but a chatbot that can easily help answer users' questions and guide them through the process of setting it up can facilitate the process.

### Feature 8: AI Powered Summary of Privacy & Consent Information

Reading through consent forms and privacy policies can be lengthy, but having an AI powered summary can reduce the legal jargon and make it more readable for elderly users.

### Feature 9: Privacy Habit Notifications

Sometimes remembering to check one's privacy settings as policies change is hard to remember, and thus an automated notification system to reminder users to do so can help recall. 

### Feature 10: Memory Lane/ Old Videos Nostalgia - Random Selection from Camera Roll

Once a month, a random photo and/or video will be selected from a person's camera roll and be posted on their personal activity feedback to allow nostalgic reflection.

### Feature 11: Encrypted Friend Addition

Users can only add and find friends through a specially generated code/password/QR code. This prevents elder users from getting friend requests from random users who may be phishers.

### Feature 12: Family approved changes to privacy settings

Parental controls can be applied to privacy and interaction settings. For example, family members of a more elder user can be authorized to restrict the user from sending cash/payments over the application.

### Feature 13: Hidden/restricted messages from potentially suspicious users

If a user gets a message or request from another user who is not verified or is found to be suspicious, their messaging ability may be restricted until manually verified.

### Feature 14: Streak tracking of medication reminders

Medication reminders can be gamified with streak tracking of when users took medications. For example, elderly users may be susceptible to forgetting to take critical medications, so public streaks can help encourage them to remain consistent.

### Feature 15: Locked chats

If a chat is predicted to be potentially involving suspicious behavior or a user is predicted to be a bot, a chat between two users can automatically lock.
