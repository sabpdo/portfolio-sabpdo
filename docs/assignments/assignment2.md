At the core concept of Duolingo lays its gamification of language learning. Could we gamify social interaction and good privacy habits? 

### Lyft

Verification for Lyft/Uber drivers based off government identification and background checks: could we apply this idea to add credibility to the actual identity of users of the app?

### Life 360

Family tracking and notifications on Life360 (Location & Battery): could we apply this idea to parental/family controls by sending automated alerts over changes privacy & app settings to maintain safety?


### Reddit 

![picture description](/assets/images/A2/reddit_anonymous_names.png)

Randomly generated names on reddit: could we apply this idea to adding friends on a social media app? In particular, when messaging a new user, one would have to outsource the user by a uniquely generated encrypted username.
