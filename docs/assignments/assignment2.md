    <p>At the core concept of Duolingo lays its gamification of language learning. Could we integrate periodic reminders and streak tracking to keep track of good privacy habits?</p>

## Feature Ideas Brainstorm

Collaborators: I helped brainstormed with Emily Chen.

### Feature 1: Adjustable Text Size
A big issue for older users tends to be the ability to read easily the text on applications/websites. A solution to this could be an adjustable slider bar that allows a user to adjust the page to the text size that would be most convenient for them.

### Feature 2: 

### Feature 3: Background Verification for Users 
Users could have a verified feature tag that is only given once they do a background check, facial recognition check, or friend referal/validation.

### Feature 4: Location-based interest sharing friend recommendation

Location tends to be a big limiting factor for more elderly users, especially as mobility declines, so there could be social/friend recommendations that are suggested based off common interests and proximity.

### Feature 5: Postings board for social events

A commmunity board for social events based off one's location and interests can be generated, where users can easily post upcoming events -- almost like job postings but for events.

### Feature 6: Voice command integration

Texting/typing can be difficult for older users, so voice commands can be integrated to do basic functionality on the app. 

### Feature 7: Video & Audio Calls - Location Based




### Feature 8: Chatbots to summarize information on privacy



### Feature 9: Leaderboard on how champion privacy or streaks if they keep updated 

### Feature 10: Memory Lane/ Old Videos Nostalgia - random selection from camerea roll

### Feature 11: Encrypted friend addition -- only through qr code, or a password

### Feature 12: Family approved changes to privacy settings (e.g. can't send money or not)

### Feature 13: Locked messages

### Feature 14: Medication reminders inbuilt - gamification

### Feature 15:
