# Assignment 6: User Testing & Analysis

## 1. Prepopulate Data

Link To Website: https://goldenbookofficial.vercel.app/

To prepopulate the website, I created a number of real potential users. For each of the users, I enabled a number of different features, ranging from creating conversations between a couple of users, managing authorizations, sending nudges, and creating posts.

You can log into my account @sabpdo, password: "password" to see one of the example profiles!

I also have four other false accounts besides my sample. I have populated the app with real messages to the accounts, posts, reminders, and authorizations. 

## 2. Task List
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Title of Task</th>
            <th>Instruction to User</th>
            <th>Rationale of Task</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Create a post</td>
            <td>
                Register for an account and create your account! <br>
                Then advertise an upcoming event that you would like to broadcast to the community, such as a local meetup or an online meeting. <br>
                Follow-up: Did you find the posting process intuitive? What are some limitations that you feel exist in the post creation and expressing yourself in the post? What are some additional features that would make it easier to find community events?
            </td>
            <td>
                Tests the ease of use and accessibility in the posting process. <br>
                Assesses if users have enough creative control/personal expression/engagement on the community board.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Send a message to another user whose event you are interested in</td>
            <td>
                Browse the community board for an event that interests you. When you find one, send a message to the host expressing your interest in attending. Share any questions or details you’d like to know about the event. <br>
                Follow-ups: Was it easy to find and contact the event host? What would make this interaction more welcoming/helpful for you? What are some limitations that you feel exist in the messaging process?
            </td>
            <td>
                Tests ease of use and clarity of messaging function, ensuring it meets the needs of elderly users for seamless and comfortable interactions. <br>
                Tests extent users are able to connect with other users through messaging.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Record a Streak-Tracked Habit</td>
            <td>
                Set up a habit you'd like to track, like a daily check-in or reminder to connect with friends or stay active. Choose something meaningful to you, and start tracking your progress. <br>
                Follow-ups: To what extent do you feel that reminders and tracking options are helpful for staying on track? If not, what would make them more useful? What limitations exist in the tracking of habits? <br>
                How motivating do you find the progress indicators or streak visuals? Do they encourage you to keep up with your habit? <br>
                Is there any way we could make it easier or more rewarding to mark each habit as complete? Are there any additional habit options or customization choices you would find helpful?
            </td>
            <td>
                Aims to understand how design supports elderly users in establishing, tracking, and sustaining healthy habits. <br>
                Learn if the setup process is clear and features like reminders are accessible and motivating. <br>
                Aims to get insights into unique needs/preferences of users in how to best support establishing habits.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Send a Social Wellness Nudge</td>
            <td>
                Send a nudge to another user. A nudge will remind them to message/stay connected with family and friends 2 days in the future. <br>
                Set it up so that you also send social wellness reminders. <br>
                Follow-ups: How easy was it for you to find and send a social wellness nudge? To what extent did you feel that sending a nudge allowed you to improve your connection/support of others? Were there any limitations/confusing aspects in sending nudges?
            </td>
            <td>
                Tests if users understand the purpose and value of sending nudges. <br>
                Gauges whether users feel motivated to use the feature. <br>
                Tests can uncover how nudges allow users to foster connection and support.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Authorize another user</td>
            <td>
                Log into a prepopulated user account that has multiple authorizations. <br>
                Username: sabpdo <br>
                Password: password <br>
                Authorize another user/caregiver who can help you manage your account, such as posting events or tracking habits. <br>
                Follow-Ups: How control the permissions on another user’s account. <br>
                Follow-Ups: How comfortable did you feel assigning permissions? How did managing another user’s permissions make you secure that the other user was protected in terms of security/privacy concerns?
            </td>
            <td>
                Tests ease of use of authorization features. <br>
                Determines users’ extent of understanding/familiarity of the purpose and functionality of authorizations. <br>
                Tells extent users feel that they are able to maintain/assert privacy and security over their own account and another account through authorizations.
            </td>
