## Functional Design

### Concept 1:
__Name__: Authorizing (Item)

__Purpose__: provide access to perform specified action

__Operational Principle__:
    after authorizing user u
    to perform action a, a
    user u can perform action a
    until access is revoked

__State__: 

    allowed: user -> __set__ action
    denied: user -> __set__ action

__Actions__: 

    allow(u:user, action: String)
        allowed[u] += action
        u in denied - action

    deny(u:user, action: String)
        denied[u] += action
        u in allowed - action

### Concept 2: 
__Name__: Authenticating

__Purpose__: authentaticate users so that app users correspond to people

__Operational Principle__: 
    
    after a user u registers with a username u and a password p and 
    a verification code v, they can authenticate by providing the unique pair
    (u, p)

__State__:

    registered: __set__ User
    username, password: registered -> __one__ String

__Actions__:

    register(name, pass: String, verificationCode: String, __out__ user:User)
        registered += (name, pass)

    authenticate(name, pass:String, __out__ user:User)
        (name, pass) in registered


### Concept 3:
__Name__: Nudging (Item)

__Purpose__: deliver a notification

__Operational Principle__: 

    a user/the system a can nudge another user b
    to complete an action a

__State__: 

    nudges: (user, user) -> __set__ String s

__Actions__: 

    nudge(a: User, b: User, action: String)
        nudges[a, b] += action


### Concept 4:

__Name__: Messaging (Item)

__Purpose__: deliver a communication

__Operational Principle__:
    user a can deliver a message
    with content c to user b

__State__:
    message: (user, user) -> String s
    mesages: __set__ message

__Actions__:
    send(a: User, b: User, c: String)
        message[a, b] = c
        messages += message

    unsend(a: User, b: User, c: String)
        messages -= message[a, b, c]

### Concept 5:

__Name__: Posting (Item)

__Purpose__: share and save content

__Operational Principle__:

    user a can post a post p
    to their account

__State__:

    user_posts: (user) -> __set__ Posts

__Actions__:

    post(a: User, p: Post)
        user_posts[a] += p

    edit(a: User, oldPost: Post, newPost: Post)
        user_posts[a] -= oldPost
        user_posts[a] += newPost
    
    delete(a: User, p: Post)
        user_posts[a] -= oldPost

### Concept 7: 

__Name__: Tracking

__Purpose__: monitor and track statistics

__Operational Principle__:

    a user u can track action a
    over a period of time t

__State__:

    actions: __set__(String s, Integer t)
    user_actions: User -> actions
    tracked_users: __set__ User

__Actions__:

    start_tracking(u: User, action: String, time: T)
        user_actions[u] = {}
        tracked_users += u
    
    record(u: User, action: String, time: T)
        if u in tracked_users:
            user_actions[u] += (action, time)

    stop_tracking(u: User, action: String, time: T)
        tracked_users -= u
