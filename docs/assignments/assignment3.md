# Assignment 3: Convergent Design

## Pitch

Do you find it hard to connect with people and find community? Well, GoldenBook will be the next big social media & community building app designed for elderly individuals. Unlike other social media apps, GoldenBook ensures that users are protected and puts security with convenience at its forefront. 

GoldenBook features a number of customizable viewing/privacy modes -- you can customize your viewing modes depending on your preferences. 

Sometimes verifying the credibility of other can be difficult, but GoldenBook provies a background verification/authorization for users to simplify this process.

No more confusing and convoluted privacy/security settings -- GoldenBook simplies the process of changing your settings and knowing how your data is managed and how your account is secure by simplifying the navigation of privacy settings with educational and visible summaries. 

GoldenBook is designed to be accessible and is made for elderly people, with input from elderly people -- featuring a social event posting board, social wellness notifications, posting, messaging, and more!
