# Project Phase 2: Divergent Design


## Broad Application Goals


__Name:__ LeftoverLove


__Intended Audience:__ The intended audience will be food services that generate food waste, food-insecure individuals who struggle with accessing nutritious meals, and volunteers who hope to help out with their community.


__Value:__ LeftoverLove is more than just a food distribution app—it's a dynamic platform that bridges the gap between food services (such as restaurants, grocery stores, and food banks) and those in need. LeftoverLove aims to reduce food waste and tackle food insecurity by harnessing the untapped potential of community, connections, and goodwill.

## Brainstorming Feature Ideas


### Feature 1: Interactive Map for Nearest Food Resources


Food-insecure individuals often struggle to find nearby food resources, especially when these resources aren't easily accessible online. This feature provides an interactive map that helps users quickly locate nearby food pantries, community fridges, and food banks, ensuring that those facing food insecurity can find the support they need with ease and convenience.


### Feature 2: Carpool/Volunteer Matching for Food Access


Transportation costs and mobility issues can make it difficult for food-insecure individuals to reach food pantries. This feature connects people in need with volunteers who can provide transportation, or it facilitates carpooling options to reduce travel costs. It helps break down barriers to accessing food while promoting more efficient food distribution, reducing both transportation-related challenges and food waste.


### Feature 3: Surplus Food Listing for Redistribution


Many restaurants dispose of unsold, leftover food at the end of the day, which contributes to food waste. This feature allows restaurants to list surplus food that is still safe for consumption, offering a way for individuals or food distribution organizations to pick it up and redistribute it to those in need, minimizing waste and addressing food insecurity.


### Feature 4: Food Waste Restaurant Leaderboard and Recognition


Encouraging restaurants and businesses to donate food can be challenging as there exists a lack of incentives for them. By gamifying the process, this feature introduces a public leaderboard that ranks businesses based on their food donation efforts. This not only incentivizes more restaurants to participate but also highlights eco-friendly businesses, fostering a community culture of sustainability and social responsibility.


### Feature 5: Filtered and Sortable Listings by Food Type


Food-insecure individuals often have specific dietary needs and may struggle to find certain types of food. This feature allows users to filter and sort available food by categories such as protein, vegetables, dairy, etc., making it easier for individuals to find the items they need and reducing food waste by ensuring food gets to the right people.


### Feature 6: Food Sharing Community Marketplace


This peer-to-peer platform could allow individuals to list surplus food they have at home—whether items nearing expiration or overstock—so that others can claim them. It promotes food redistribution within the community, reducing household waste and providing a valuable resource to those in need, while also encouraging a culture of sharing and sustainability.


### Feature 7: Food Waste Analytics Dashboard


Users and organizations often struggle to measure the impact of their food waste initiatives. A comprehensive dashboard can track the volume of food rescued, donated, and redistributed within a specific area, providing valuable insights into trends and outcomes.


### Feature 8: Anonymous Food Distribution System


To reduce stigma, users can make anonymous requests for food assistance through the app and can pick up food from accessible, safe, and non-judgmental drop-off locations such as fire stations or community centers. Volunteers or food providers can respond without revealing the identity of the requestor, maintaining privacy and dignity for those in need.


### Feature 9: Recipe Recommendations for Surplus Ingredients


Coming up with feasible recipes with a limited subset of ingredients can be difficult. When users claim surplus food, the app can suggest simple recipes using those ingredients, helping recipients make the most of what they have.


### Feature 10: Crowdsource Food Pantry Supplies


Allow food pantries to post what resources are needed most so donors who use the app will know what and to whom to donate to have the greatest impact and to enable a more targeted donation system.


### Feature 11: Food Rescue Heatmap


Display a visual heatmap displaying areas with high levels of food waste and food insecurity (based on the number of excess food listings and food requests), helping users and organizations identify where their efforts could have the most impact, where they could establish new food pantries, or where they could make more efforts to educate people about food waste and best practices.


### Feature 12: Gamified Volunteer System


The app could award points or rewards for volunteer contributions, such as delivering food or organizing redistribution efforts, and display leaderboards, award badges, and include other forms of community recognition. This would encourage consistent participation and make it a fun activity for people to do with school clubs, company groups, or with friends to make a positive impact in their community.


### Feature 13: Safe Food Handling Guidelines


When donors list food and when volunteers transport it, display a built-in guide on safe food handling practices such as proper storage and transportation methods. This would ensure that all redistributed food is safe to consume and will stay fresh throughout donation and transportation.


### Feature 14: Zero-Waste Restaurant Certification


The app could include a certification program for restaurants that consistently participate in food redistribution, providing them with a badge they could display on their website or in the store so that customers know about their green practices.


### Feature 15: Smart Pickup Scheduling


Enable users to schedule convenient pickup times at food redistribution points, including queue management to reduce waiting times and improve user experience.


### Feature 16: Real Time Inventory Updates


This feature allows food pantries, community fridges, and food banks to update inventory in real-time. Users can check availability of specific items before making the trip, saving time and resources.
### Feature 17: Digital Food Voucher System


A voucher feature allows donors to purchase digital food vouchers that food-insecure individuals can redeem at participating local stores, providing more direct and dignified access to food.
### Feature 18: Volunteer Safety/Training Resource


Provide training resources, such as videos or guides, to ensure volunteers know best practices for safe food handling, delivery, and interacting with users who may have specific needs.
### Feature 19: In-app Messaging for Users/Volunteers


Enable users and volunteers to coordinate securely within the app, allowing for quick and safe communication regarding food pickups, last-minute changes, or assistance needs.


### Feature 20: Health and Nutrition Tips


Provide users with health tips and nutritional advice tailored to the food items they receive. This could include educational content on balanced diets, portion control, and managing chronic health conditions through diet.
### Feature 21: Time-Sensitive Food Alerts


Notify users when perishable food items are available but must be claimed quickly to avoid spoilage, encouraging quick response and reducing food waste.


### Feature 22: Rate and Review Providers


Rating and reviewing different donors could provide a greater sense of transparency and user experience when dealing with food from restaurants, households, etc. This is different from the certifications in the prior ideas, but it gives a qualitative view from the users themselves.


### Feature 23: Dietary Needs on Profiles


This builds on feature 5, where instead of just searching and filtering by dietary needs, the users / recipients can add these things to their profile (which adds useful personalization that improves UX), such that…


### Feature 24: Dietary Need Food Preference Matching


…a user is notified when food is available nearby that meets their preferences and restrictions. This just makes things more streamlined and reactive for the user.


### Feature 25: Donated Food Claiming
This makes claiming food an easy and efficient process, and users can browse available donations from nearby restaurants and claim items directly through the app to reserve them for pickup. This system allows users to reserve specific items and get access to the food they need.
### Feature 26: Group Requests


If several families or households in an area need food, they can submit a joint request and be prioritized in the redistribution of food waste. This incentivizes larger groups of people to more proactively seek the food they need and opens up a new use case.


### Feature 27: Food Receipt Logs


Keep track of what food users receive and when, which could be useful for researchers in the long run. This log also helps the user keep track of trends.


### Feature 28: Culinary Education


Advertise cooking classes in the area so that the food insecure can use their ingredients to create healthy recipes. This helps recipients make the most of their food, providing a hidden benefit beyond receiving aid.


### Feature 29: Wellness Dashboard


Just remind users to maintain healthy habits outside of their food, allow some private goal setting, etc. though this is definitely not an essential part of the app. This could be adjacent to the greater goals.


### Feature 30: Accessibility Features


To make it accessible for all users, do simple things like text to speech, light/dark mode, change size of buttons and font, preserve anonymity, etc. For example, users that might be a larger subset of food-insecure individuals may be elderly users or users with less education, so having more signaling, visual features, and guided explanations will be important.

### Feature 31: Carbon Footprint for Food

Estimating one's carbon footprint can be challenging, especially when it comes to the impact of daily food choices. This app could function similarly to MyFitnessPal, but instead of tracking calories, it would calculate and display the carbon footprint of each food item consumed. This way, users can better understand the environmental impact of their dietary habits and make more sustainable choices.

## Storyboarding and Sketching


### Storyboard 1: Food-Insecure Individual Claiming Food Donation


(Goal: If a food-insecure individual does not have access to food, they can easily view food donation listings on the application and claim a donation that will be delivered to them.)


![Food-Insecure Individual Requesting Food](/assets/images/Assignments/P2/FoodInsecure.png)


### Storyboard 2: Restaurant Posts Food Listing


(Goal: If a restaurant has excess/leftover food, they can post a food donation listing on the application for the community that can be later claimed and delivered.)
