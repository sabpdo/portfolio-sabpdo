# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan

### Hunch:

I aim to design a social media app that empowers older users to confidently identify and manage privacy and security protections, without overwhelming them or compromising their sense of trust and connection, as they are often more vulnerable to these threats.

### Who I Am Interviewing & Why:

My intended target audience was older/elderly users. To get a comprehensive view, I wanted to get a bit of variance between the two people I interviewed in terms of age and background. 

**Why I Chose Lauren**

In my conversation with Lauren, a 60-year-old woman who was born and raised in the Midwest, I gained valuable insights into how technology has evolved over the years. Her background in marketing and data gives her a nuanced understanding of the dual role data plays in modern applications—serving as both a powerful tool and a potential risk. I chose to interview Lauren to explore how someone from an older demographic approaches privacy and security in the digital age, given her unique perspective on the benefits and challenges of data usage. Now retired, Lauren primarily uses technology to stay connected with family and keep herself informed.

**Why I Chose Tam**

I chose to interview Tam, a 80-year-old woman/grandmother, because her experiences offer a distinct generational and cultural perspective. As an immigrant who spent most of her life in Vietnam, she brings unique insights into how someone from an older generation, with limited exposure to technology, navigates the digital world. Unlike Lauren, who belongs to the baby boomer generation and has more familiarity with technology, my grandmother is less adept with modern tools, relying primarily on Facebook to stay connected with her five children and over ten grandchildren. Her perspective is particularly valuable in understanding how older, less tech-savvy immigrants engage with technology and manage privacy concerns in a digital age that can feel foreign to them.

### Planning Materials

#### Guiding Questions:
Primarily, I made sure to divide my questions into two parts: (1) questions regarding the interviewee's experiences with privacy/security with other users and (2) experiences with privacy and security with an application itself.

1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself (e.g. occupation, hobbies)?
2. What are the social media apps/websites you enjoy using the most? What do you like about them?

__Privacy In Relation to Other Users__

3. Have you ever gotten a strange email or message that made you suspicious? What did you do?

3a. Specific examples based off applications:
- Facebook/IG: For example, have you ever been asked to enter your credit card information on an unfamiliar site or app? What did you do?
- Email: Have you ever gotten an email with a suspicious link?

3b. What about it made you suspicious?

3. Have you ever experienced someone using or having access to your shared/personal information in a way that made you uncomfortable?
4. When sharing content online, how do you decide who can see it?
5. When you interact with other onlines, are there privacy settings you find important for controlling those interactions? Which settings do you prioritize?

__Privacy In Relation to an Application__

6. Can you recall a time when an app or website made you feel unsure about the safety of your personal information? What happened, and how did you handle it?
7. What apps make you feel more comfortable about your privacy and why?
8. How do you decide if an app or website is trustworthy? What makes you feel confident using it?
9. Have you ever found it confusing or easy to adjust privacy or security settings in apps? Can you share a specific experience?
10. How often do you adjust an app's privacy settings after installation?
11. If you wanted to get better at protecting your information online, how would you go about it? Has anything worked for you in the past?
12. When you use apps, do you usually check what kind of information/permissions they ask for? Why or why not?
13. Do you usually read terms and conditions or privacy policies when you sign up for an app? Why or why not?

## Interview Report

### Report for Lauren
During my conversation with Ms. Rednour, an interesting tension emerged around her relationship with technology—balancing the convenience it offers with concerns about privacy and security. As a daily tech user, she sees herself as fairly savvy. However, as we dug deeper, a divide became clear between her understanding of security in relation to other users and how apps themselves handle her data. Privacy, she emphasized, was a "priority." Yet when asked about her engagement with privacy settings, she expressed surprise, admitting she didn't even know they existed and that she had never explored them before. This revealed a gap between her stated values and her actual behavior, highlighting a common contradiction between ideals and practice. Ms. Rednour’s trust in an app’s security is closely tied to its technical quality. As she explained, "If you don’t have basic functionality, how do I feel secure that my data is gonna be secure?" For her, reliability and security are interlinked—if an app can’t perform simple tasks well, she doubts its ability to protect her data. Yet despite this belief, she admitted that she doesn’t investigate how apps handle her data beyond an initial check. Instead, she relies on surface-level markers like app ratings or general functionality to build a sense of credibility. While she cares about data security, she doesn’t always take the necessary steps to actively protect it.

One of the most revealing moments came when Ms. Rednour discussed privacy policies. Although she values privacy, she confessed she doesn’t have the patience to read full privacy terms, preferring concise summaries. "Probably less than 1% of people read all of" the terms and conditions, she said with a smile. Here, the tension between convenience and privacy emerged again. While she finds cookie pop-ups annoying, she still appreciates them because they "force me to set privacy settings." This acknowledgment shows that privacy, while important to her, is often deprioritized in favor of convenience.Ultimately, Ms. Rednour’s reflections capture a broader negotiation that many users experience. We claim to value privacy and security, but our day-to-day interactions with technology tell a different story—one where convenience often wins out. Thus, this tension suggests that solutions that foster both trust and ease that don't compromising on convenience will be the most impactful for users.

## Design Opportunities
1. Trusted Contact Feature
Users should be able to designate trusted contacts who can assist with managing privacy settings and address security issues. Trusted contacts could receive notifications if unusual activity is detected, or help prevent risky actions such as clicking on suspicious links or sending money to unknown recipients.

2. Education & Visibility of Privacy Policies
One feature suggestion is the creation of an interactive chatbot that is trained over the terms and conditions of a website/application and the privacy matters. This chat bot would be able to summarize current privacy and data policies and answer questions that the user has and easily guide users in setting their privacy settings.

Many users, including Lauren, expressed frustration with lengthy privacy descriptions, stating, “It is hard to read all the terms and conditions.” An interactive chatbot would bridge this gap by offering easily digestible information and guiding users through the process, ensuring they understand their privacy options and make informed decisions. 

3. Credibility as a Tool for User Verification

The app  should include a credibility score indicator for users, displayed on a dedicated tab or page within the app. This score could be based on various factors such as photo or government ID verification, user reports, interaction history, and background checks.

Having a visible flag can easily allow for users to establish credibility (or lack of credibility) for other users on the app for users like Lauren rather than requiring users to manually combing through and verifying everybody they interact with. Posts from users with high reports or low trustworthiness can be deprioritized in the feed algorithm.

4. The Ease of Forgetting: Privacy Alerts
Automatic alerts can be integrated into an application to notify users when unusual activity is detected or significant change in privacy settings occurs. These alerts can be configured to occur periodically, encouraging users to recheck and adjust their privacy settings as needed. 

Automatic alerts help address the common issue of users forgetting to manage their privacy settings, such as Lauren, who admitted to not frequently revisiting her privacy settings. Regular, contextual alerts can ensure that users stay informed about potential issues and maintain their desired level of privacy without having to actively monitor settings constantly.
