# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan

### Hunch:

I aim to design a social media app that addresses the pitfalls of current social media apps by mitigating common privacy and security concerns/threats that older/elderly users face. The app should empower elderly users to confidently identify and manage privacy and security protections, without overwhelming them or compromising their sense of trust and connection.

### Who I Am Interviewing & Why:

My intended target audience was older/elderly users. To get a comprehensive view, I wanted to get a bit of variance between the two people I interviewed in terms of age and background. 

**Why I Chose Lauren**

In my conversation with Lauren, a 60-year-old woman who was born and raised in the Midwest, I gained valuable insights into how technology has evolved over the years. Her background in marketing and data gives her a nuanced understanding of the role data plays in modern applications—serving as both a tool and a potential risk. I chose to interview Lauren to explore how someone from an older demographic approaches privacy and security in the digital age, given her unique perspective on the benefits and challenges of data usage. Now retired, Lauren primarily uses technology to stay connected with family and friends and keep herself informed/educated.

**Why I Chose Tam**

I chose to interview Tam, a 80-year-old woman/grandmother, because her experiences offer a distinct generational and cultural perspective. As an immigrant who spent most of her life in Vietnam, she brings unique insights into how someone from an older generation, with limited exposure to technology, navigates the digital world. Unlike Lauren, who belongs to the baby boomer generation and has more familiarity with technology, my grandmother is less adept with modern tools, relying primarily on Facebook to stay connected with her five children and over ten grandchildren. Her perspective is particularly valuable in understanding how older, less tech-savvy immigrants engage with technology and manage privacy concerns in a digital age that can feel foreign to them.

### Planning Materials

#### Guiding Questions:
Primarily, I divided my questions into two parts: (1) questions regarding the interviewee's experiences with privacy/security with other users and (2) experiences with privacy and security with an application itself.

1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself (e.g. occupation, hobbies)?
2. What are the social media apps/websites you enjoy using the most? What do you like about them?

__Privacy In Relation to Other Users__

3. Have you ever gotten a strange email or message that made you suspicious? What did you do?

3a. Specific examples based off applications:
- Facebook/IG: For example, have you ever been asked to enter your credit card information on an unfamiliar site or app? What did you do?
- Email: Have you ever gotten an email with a suspicious link?

3b. What about it made you suspicious?

3. Have you ever experienced someone using or having access to your shared/personal information in a way that made you uncomfortable?
4. When sharing content online, how do you decide who can see it?
5. When you interact with other onlines, are there privacy settings you find important for controlling those interactions? Which settings do you prioritize?

__Privacy In Relation to the Application__

6. Can you recall a time when an app or website made you feel unsure about the safety of your personal information? What happened, and how did you handle it?
7. What apps make you feel more comfortable about your privacy and why?
8. How do you decide if an app or website is trustworthy? What makes you feel confident using it?
9. Have you ever found it confusing or easy to adjust privacy or security settings in apps? Can you share a specific experience?
10. How often do you adjust an app's privacy settings after installation?
11. If you wanted to get better at protecting your information online, how would you go about it? Has anything worked for you in the past?
12. When you use apps, do you usually check what kind of information/permissions they ask for? Why or why not?
13. Do you usually read terms and conditions or privacy policies when you sign up for an app? Why or why not?



## Raw Interview Notes

During the interviews, I asked for consent to record, and then took notes and direct quotes when listening back to it.

Attached are my PDF notes for both interviews.

## Interview Report

### Report for Lauren
During my conversation with Lauren, an interesting tension emerged around her relationship with technology—balancing the convenience it offers with concerns about privacy and security. As a daily tech user, she sees herself as fairly savvy. However, as we dug deeper, a divide became clear between her understanding of security in relation to how apps themselves handle her data. Privacy, she emphasized, was a "priority." Yet when asked about her engagement with privacy settings, she expressed surprise, admitting she didn't even know they existed and that she had never explored them before. This revealed a gap between her stated values and her actual behavior, highlighting a common contradiction between ideals and practice. Lauren’s trust in an app’s security is closely tied to its technical quality. As she explained, "If you don’t have basic functionality, how do I feel secure that my data is gonna be secure?" For her, reliability and security are interlinked—if an app can’t perform simple tasks well, she doubts its ability to protect her data. However, despite this belief, she admitted that she doesn’t investigate how apps handle her data beyond an initial check. Instead, she relies on surface-level markers like app ratings or general functionality to build a sense of credibility. While she cares about data security, she doesn’t always take the necessary steps to actively protect it.

One of the most revealing moments came when Lauren discussed privacy policies. Although she values privacy, she confessed she doesn’t have the patience to read full privacy terms, preferring concise summaries. "Probably less than 1% of people read all of" the terms and conditions, she said with certainty. Convenience and privacy seem to be at odds with each other in current modern day social media platforms. While she finds cookie pop-ups annoying, she still appreciates them because they "force me to set privacy settings." This acknowledgment shows that privacy, while important to her, is often deprioritized in favor of convenience. Ultimately, Lauren’s reflections capture a broader dilemma that many users experience. Users claim to value privacy and security, but in day-to-day convenience often wins out. Thus, this tension suggests that solutions that foster both trust and ease but don't compromise on convenience will be the most impactful for users.


### Report for Tam
Tam’s reflections on her use of Facebook reveal a nuanced relationship marked by both appreciation and frustration. She values Facebook’s connectivity, explaining, “I use Facebook to see what other people are doing and to communicate with family.” However, this positive experience is overshadowed by previously faced security issues. Often, she'll get messages that her account is hacked and reach out to family for advice on what to do. In fact, she has even been scammed in the past, by blinding trusting an account that she thought was her friend, which has led to her being more cautious with online interactions. Her previous experiences with scams on online transactions in particular has led her to be more cautious. When buying items on Facebook Marketplace, she recalls, “I tend to look at the negative reviews first,” showing a shift towards skepticism and a lack of trust in the app's mechanisms. For her now, not even positive reviews guarantee reliability: “Even with good reviews, there are still scammers.” This underscores her mistrust in the platform’s ability to filter out fraudulent actors and failure of Facebook to do so in the past. Tam’s struggle to distinguish between genuine users and potential scammers underscores the urgent need for enhanced protective systems to safeguard elderly users from online fraud.

A notable contradiction in Tam’s experience is her awareness of privacy issues versus her lack of knowledge on how to address them. She admits, “I don’t know how to protect my information online,” highlighting a broader challenge in balancing user convenience with effective privacy management. Her lack of knowledge also suggests a need for more education on actionable steps to promote privacy and security -- users know privacy is an issue but not **HOW** to solve it. There is a gap between the platform's promise of connectivity and the user's need for security and privacy. Tam’s experiences illustrates the need for significant improvements in verification systems as well as the development of more intuitive privacy controls in new social media application to better align with users' needs and concerns.

## Design Opportunities

1. Education & Visibility of Privacy Policies

One feature suggestion is the creation of an interactive chatbot that is trained over the terms and conditions of a website/application and the privacy matters. This chat bot would be able to summarize current privacy and data policies and answer questions that the user has. It could also easily walk users through their privacy settings.

Many users, including Lauren, expressed frustration with lengthy privacy descriptions, stating, “It is hard to read all the terms and conditions.” An interactive chatbot would bridge this gap by offering easily digestible information and guiding users through the process, ensuring they understand their privacy options and make informed decisions. 

2. Credibility as a Tool for User Verification

The app should include a credibility score indicator for users, displayed on a dedicated tab or page within the app. This score could be based on various factors such as photo or government ID verification, user reports, interaction history, and background checks.

Having a visible flag can easily allow for users to establish credibility (or lack of credibility) for other users on the app for users like Lauren rather than requiring users to manually combing through and verifying everybody they interact with. Posts from users with high reports or low trustworthiness can be deprioritized in the feed algorithm. This feature is essential for users like Tam, who may struggle with assessing the credibility of individuals.

3. The Ease of Forgetting: Privacy Alerts

Automatic alerts can be integrated into a social media application to notify users when unusual activity is detected or significant change in privacy settings occurs. These alerts can be configured to occur periodically, encouraging users to recheck and adjust their privacy settings as needed. 

Automatic alerts help address the common issue of users forgetting to manage their privacy settings, such as Lauren, who admitted to not frequently revisiting her privacy settings. Regular, contextual alerts can ensure that users stay informed about potential issues and maintain their desired level of privacy without having to actively monitor settings constantly.

4. Trusted Contact Feature

Users should be able to designate trusted contacts who can assist with managing privacy settings and address security issues. Trusted contacts could receive notifications if unusual activity is detected, or help prevent risky actions such as clicking on suspicious links or sending money to unknown recipients.

For users like Tam, having a trusted contact manage privacy settings may make management and mitigating scams easier if a trusted contact, like a family member, has more knowledge.
