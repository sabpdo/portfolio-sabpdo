# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan

### Hunch:

How might we design an app that helps older users mitigate and identify privacy and security threats?

### Who I Am Interviewing & Why:

**Interviewee 1: Lauren Rednour**

Lauren Rednour is a ~50 retired, stay at home mom. I chose to interview her because of (1) the generational difference and (2) the difference in our backgrounds. She is white and was born and raised in the midwest. She uses multiple forms of social media (primarily Instagram and LinkedIn), and has one daughter.

**Interviewee 2: Tam Nguyen**

My grandma is 80+ and stays at home. I chose to interview because of the generational difference and her experience being an immigrant. She differs from the perspective of Ms. Rednour as she is in an even older generation than Ms. Rednour (baby boomer), and relatively, she is less familiar and adept with technology in general. She primarily only uses one form of social media: Facebook. She also provides a different perspective as she is an immigrant having lived in Vietnam for most of her life. She has 5 children and 10+ grandchildren.

### Planned Questions

#### Guiding Principles as I Designed my Interview:

- Ask for consent
- Goals: Get them comfortable → build rapport → evoke stories
- Don’t ask too designer questions/leading questions
- Unpack contradictions
- During interview, can veer off pre-made questions based off responses

#### Questions:

- How are you?
  - Icebreakers, Get them comfortable
- What are the apps/websites you enjoy using the most?
  - What do you like about them?
- Have you ever gotten a strange email or message that made you suspicious? What did you do?
  - Specific examples based off applications:
    - Facebook/IG: For example, have you ever been asked to enter your credit card information on an unfamiliar site or app? What did you do?
    - Email: Have you ever gotten an email with a suspicious link?
  - What about it made you suspicious?
- Can you recall a time when an app or website made you feel unsure about the safety of your personal information?
  - What happened, and how did you handle it?
- What apps make you feel more comfortable about your privacy and why?
  - How do you decide if an app or website is trustworthy? What makes you feel confident using it?
- Have you ever found it confusing or easy to adjust privacy or security settings in apps? Can you share a specific experience?
- If you wanted to get better at protecting your information online, how would you go about it?
  - Has anything worked for you in the past?
- When you use apps, do you usually check what kind of information they ask for? Why or why not?
  - Do you usually read terms and conditions or privacy policies when you sign up for an app? Why or why not?
  - What would make it easier for you to understand those documents?
