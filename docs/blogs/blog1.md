# Blog 1: Reflection on Lecture 6


After Tuesday's class, I began reflecting on how the tension between automation and flexibility plays out across various applications. In this post, I see if I could identify and highlight examples where the balance between automation and flexibility manifests in everyday tools (specifically the tightening of concepts).

A notable example of this contrast is found in cars—particularly in the difference between Tesla’s self-driving vehicles and traditional cars. Tesla is known for its minimalist design and user-friendly interface, consolidating various controls into a sleek touchscreen. While this design provides convenience and aesthetic simplicity, it also reduces flexibility. One specific feature that comes to mind is Tesla’s regenerative braking system. In traditional cars, drivers must press the brake pedal to slow down. However, in Teslas, braking is integrated into the driving pedal itself (well is the primary braking option), meaning the car automatically decelerates when the driver lifts their foot. This merging of functions (concepts in this case, accelerating and stopping) however can reduce the driver's direct control and flexibility in controlling the car.

Another example is autocorrect in modern typing systems, such as texting. These systems automatically correct errors as you type, sometimes replacing words without explicit permission. This reflects a "tightening"; the concepts of flagging incorrect words and typing are merged together as user input and machine suggestions are combined. Automation takes over the manual process of reviewing and fixing mistakes.

In email applications like Outlook, we see a more subtle example with the "Reply" and "Reply All" buttons. The existence of the "Reply All" button simplifies the process of responding to multiple recipients without the need to manually enter each address. This automation is convenient but can also lead to unintentional over-communication, demonstrating how even small design choices reflect the trade-off between flexibility and automation.

In today's world, most applications lean toward tightening design moves, as exemplified in lecture, (over loosening design moves) for the sake of convenience. However, this raises the question: at what point does automation go too far, limiting the user's control, simplicity, and flexibility?
